THE TRACKER IS DEDICATED TO KEEPING TRACK OF _BUGS_,
preferably after they have been already discussed and confirmed to be reproducible.

FOR ASSISTANCE, PLEASE CLOSE THIS FORM AND USE THE DISCUSSIONS SECTION INSTEAD:
https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/discussions

Installation, configuration, usage guidance and issues in 3rd party packages are not bugs, but individual assistance requests.

If the bug is not trivial to reproduce on any platform, please include ALL the steps required to reliably duplicate it, on a vanilla, generic install of macOS, Windows, OpenBSD or Ubuntu Linux system, in their most current version.

Try to reproduce it using the current `libsodium-stable` package, installed as documented in https://doc.libsodium.org/installation .

If you don't have any clear understanding of the issue or can't enumerate the steps to reproduce it, open a discussion instead: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/discussions

Thank you! üòäüôè
