Please do not post features requests directly.

The starting point should be a discussion, after having checked the roadmap: https://doc.libsodium.org/roadmap

Suggestions should be raised as an "Ideas" discussion: https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/discussions

We can then determine if the discussion needs to be escalated into a "planned change" or not.

This will help us ensure that the issue tracker properly reflects ongoing or needed work on the project.

Thank you! 😊🙏
